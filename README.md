This repository includes the simulation  for the manuscript submitted in Statistical Methods in Medical Research. The beta-binomial piecewise growth mixture model (BB PGMM) is specifically
designed to address longitudinal overdispersed binomial responses. Within each class, we fit a piecewise linear beta-binomial mixed model with random changepoints for each study group to
detect critical windows of treatment efficacy. Using this model, we can cluster subjects who share similar characteristics, estimate the class-specific mean abstinence trends for each study group,
and quantify the treatment effect over time within each class.
